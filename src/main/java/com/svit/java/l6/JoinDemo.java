/**
 * 
 * Code is for study and personal use purpose, not for commercial use.
 * 
 * The join() method of a Thread instance can be used to "join" the start of a thread's execution to the end of another thread's 
 * execution so that a thread will not start running until another thread has ended. If join() is called on a Thread instance, 
 * the currently running thread will block until the Thread instance has finished executing.
 * 
 * The ThreadExample class creates a RunnableJob object. It creates 4 threads named "T1", "T2", "T3", and "T4" with the 
 * RunnableJob object. It calls start() and then join() on each thread, in order. This blocks the execution of the 
 * current (main) thread from proceeding until the thread has completed. This means that the main thread will block for 1 second 
 * at each join(), since the RunnableJob sleeps for 1 second. Following this, ThreadExample creates 4 more threads, 
 * "T5", "T6", "T7", and "T8". This time, no joins are called on these threads, so the main thread will not block. *
